### About Me:
#### I'm 22 years old, from Salt Lake City and I'm passionate about technology, problem solving, and providing creative solutions. I'm a software developer that loves to improve and expand my skills and knowledge. If I'm not learning something new or working on a project you can find me exercising, playing on my Nintendo Switch, or drawing.
