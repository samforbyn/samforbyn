### About Me:
#### I'm 21 years old, I have a love for technology, problem solving, analytical thinking, as well as understanding how and why things work. Currently I am a student developer, with hopes of being able to develop applications and/or systems using Python full time. I strongly believe that to expand, increase, or build upon a knowledge base you must immerse yourself into that environment. You're not going to get better at cycling if you only ride your bicylce one a week. Same for playing any sport, learning any subject, or bettering yourself in any way, really... To truly progress at a satisfactory rate - immersing yourself through repitition and consistency will take you where you need to be.
